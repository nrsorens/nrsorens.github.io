## Kevin Kevin Revolution

### Background

[Kevin Kevin Revolution][live] is an implementation of the popular 4-arrow rhythm game Dance Dance Revolution where players must press corresponding arrow keys as they scroll past the top line of arrows. The twist is that the gameplay doesn't end until the user misses too many consecutive arrows and causes life points to reach 0, and users have to use the motion of their arms to play, rather than using their feet or the arrow keys on their keyboard.

Kevin Kevin Revolution is a twist on Endless Revolution, originally created by Gary Yeh.

### Instructions

* Choose a mode (Left Arm, Right Arm, Both Arms) to begin/restart

* Move the corresponding arm just as an arrow crosses the top row of gray arrows

* You start with 100 life. Missed arrows deduct your life points while successful arrow hits increase them, up to 200.

* If your life hits 0, the game ends!

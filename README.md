## Kevin Kevin Revolution

### Background

[Kevin Kevin Revolution][live] is an implementation of the popular 4-arrow rhythm game Dance Dance Revolution where players must press corresponding arrow keys as they scroll past the top line of arrows. The twist is that the gameplay doesn't end until the user misses too many consecutive arrows and causes life points to reach 0.

Kevin Kevin Revolution is a twist on Endless Revolution, originally created by Gary Yeh.
